# MapBuilder2

This is a project based on random generation. It randomly generates a World that holds randomly generated Lands that holds randomly generated Maps that will have different randomly generated layouts with randomly generated Rooms.

The World is traversable by moving around square by square.

TODO:

Make the game into a fantasy world inspired by Diablo and Darkfall.

Eventually I will add mounted movement as well as bunnyhopping and teleportation through items such as runestones and portal shards.

The character you control will have a variety of skills that will be learned from randomly generated NPCs once you have skill enough in them. These skills include spells, melee, archery, as well as a variety of passives.

Randomly generated mob spawns will allow for the player to fight and farm for mats to craft gear at randomly generated crafting stations. Different parts of the world will have different types of mob spawns that will drop different mats needed for the variety of gear.

This gear will build your character to allow him to descend into the dungeon in the middle of the map for the end goal of the game: to kill the Demon.
